## Course 3: Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

The third course focuses on the six-part iterative process of Explanatory Data Analysis
1. Discovering
2. Structuring
3. Cleaning
4. Joining
5. Validating
6. Presenting

<b>
  Module 1: Find and share stories using data
</b>
<p>In module 1, we went through the benefits and basic methods of data cleaning, and explored different ways to visualise data. Thisw as done by exploring a case study centred around the global firm, Deloitte.  </p>

<b>
  Module 2: Explore raw data
</b>
<p>Use Python to perform the EDA practices of <b>discovering</b> and <b>structuring.</b> The module started with the theory of understanding raw data: its sources, formats, data types etc. Afterwards, this basic data functions were implemented on Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. </p>

<b>
  Module 3: Clean your data
</b>
<p>Module 3 covers three more EDA practices: <b>cleaning, joining and validating.</b> Through this module, we learn methods to handle missing data, outliers, and transform categorical data into numerical data. We join and concatenate data frames, and carry out input validation.</p>
