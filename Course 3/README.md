## Course 3: Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

The third course focuses on the six-part iterative process of Explanatory Data Analysis
1. Discovering
2. Structuring
3. Cleaning
4. Joining
5. Validating
6. Presenting


__Module 1: Find and share stories using data__
- In module 1, we went through the benefits and basic methods of data cleaning, and explored different ways to visualise data. Thisw as done by exploring a case study centred around the global firm, Deloitte.
 

__Module 2: Explore raw data__
- Use Python to perform the EDA practices of __discovering__ and __structuring.__ The module started with the theory of understanding raw data: its sources, formats, data types etc. Afterwards, this basic data functions were implemented on Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.

__Module 3: Clean your data__
- Module 3 covers three more EDA practices: __cleaning, joining and validating.__ Through this module, we learn methods to handle missing data, outliers, and transform categorical data into numerical data. We join and concatenate data frames, and carry out input validation.

__Module 4: Data visualisations and presentations__
- Describe Module 4

__Module 5: Course 3 end-of-course project__
- Describe Module 5
