## Course 2: Get Started with Python

The second course focused on learning the basics of Python programming on Jupyter Notebook. <br>

Module 1: Hello, Python! started with introducing the 5 main considerations when choosing a programming language for data analytics: 
* speed
* approachability
* variables
* data science focus
* programming paradigm.

Then Python was compared to other major languages usch as R, Java and C++. Finally, we were introduced to simple Python concepts like Objects, Classes, Methods, Dot Notation etc.

The second module focused on functions and conditional statements. After briefly covering Python programming conventions, the course covered conditional statements: IF, ELIF and ELSE.  

The third module titled "Loops and Strings" started with a detailed explanation and practice of WHILE and FOR loops, and RANGE functions. Afterwards we were given information on working with strings including string slicing, formatting, partitioning and regular expressions. 

Module 4 covered data structures in Python in depth. Starting with Lists, the course went over various mutable and immutable structures including tuples, sets and dictionaries. Then we were introduced to Python packages where we focused on Numpy as it allows to manipulate multidimensional arrays and matrix data structures. Afterwards we worked with the pandas package to manipulate and analyse tabular data. 

Finally, the end-of-course project required us to import data, create a dataframe, inspect data, idenfy outliers, create a data visualisation and write an executive summary.
