### Course 2 Project
The program provided us with three different scenarios for our project, and we were advised to utilise the same scenario throughout the certification program. 
The three projects:
- Estimating taxi fares for Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm
- Classifying claims made in Tiktok, a popular short-form video platform
- Predicting user churn on Waze, a navigation app, 

I have chosen Waze as the scenario I will work with throughout the program. A short overview of the course 2 project has been given below, with an in-depth explanation available in the project folder.
