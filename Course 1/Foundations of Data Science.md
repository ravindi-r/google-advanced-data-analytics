## Course 1: Foundations of Data Science
TODO: Add a summary of the content that was covered in course 1

### Course 1 Project
The program provided us with three different scenarios for our project, and we were advised to utilise the same scenario throughout the certification program. 
The three projects:
- Estimating taxi fares for Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm
- Classifying claims made in Tiktok, a popular short-form video platform
- Predicting user churn on Waze, a navigation app, 

I have chosen Waze as the scenario I will work with throughout the program. A short overview of the course 1 project has been given below, with an in-depth explanation available in the project folder.

### Waze
#### Project goal
Waze leadership has asked your data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled or stopped using the Waze app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

#### Background
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer.

#### Scenario
You are the newest member of Waze’s data team. Your team is about to begin their user churn project. The first step is to create a project proposal. The proposal will clearly define the overall goal of the project, and identify key tasks, milestones, and stakeholders.

#### Course 1 tasks
- Assign PACE stages to the requested tasks for the user churn project
- Organize tasks into milestones
- Create a project proposal for the Waze data team
