## Course 1: Foundations of Data Science

Throughout this first course, I was introduced to the basics of the Data Science field. We started by defining terms such as Data Science and Data Analytics, going through a typical data toolbox, and looking at the career profiles of individuals who work in a data team. 

Afterwards, the course went through the ideal qualities for a data analytics professional, including being coachable, keeping up with trends and being enthusiastic about developing new skills, strong interpersonal skills and communication, problem-solving, etc. 

Afterwards, I got to know about some of the important ethical considerations I should keep in mind such as maintaining and protecting user privacy and good data stewardship.  

Talking about organising data teams, I was introduced to four classifications of involvement:
* Responsible
* Accountable
* Consulted
* Informed

The course then went through the PACE Framework, which we were advised to use throughout a Data Analytics project to help solve problems and make judgements quickly and efficiently
* Plan
* Analyse
* Construct
* Execute

Finally, I was guided through writing effective project proposals and executive summaries as a member of a data team.
